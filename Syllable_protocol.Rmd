Before syllable parsing, we replaced the phonemes by larger categories:

- T: corresponds to obstruents (consonants like T, which typically occur as first unit of an onset only);

- R: corresponds to sonorants (consonants like R, which typically occur as onset- first or second unit- or coda);

- V: corresponds to vowels;

- D: corresponds to glides on the right of a vowel, therefore, forming a diphthong.
