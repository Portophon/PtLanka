## PtLanka: an online corpus of Sri Lanka Portuguese lexicon and phonology
(to be released in https://sites.google.com/view/opencor-2021/)

Sri Lanka Portuguese is an endangered creole spoken by members of the island’s Burgher ethnic group of Portuguese and Dutch ancestry (Smith,2013). In spite of an intensive documentation at the end of the 19th century, the accessible lexical data of this creole is severely limited. Therefore, the existing quantitative approaches to its lexicon and phonology are based in a set of just 200 words (Clements,2012) from the Tamil-dominant region of the island only. The PtLanka database assembles a total of 2524 words of Sri Lanka Portuguese from its most complete dictionary (Dalgado,1900), which covers the lexicon from the extinct dialect of Colombo from the Sinhala-dominant region, and make it available online in a consistent format. Apart from the original orthography and notes, the database also includes a phonetic transcription, updated definition in Portuguese and English for each word, and some morphological annotation. This database makes it possible for researchers to explore the linguistic data, to formulate hypotheses on how the Sri Lanka Portuguese was formed and evolved and to assess the effects of contact with other languages, namely Dutch and English. Databases like this are  also instrumental in language documentation and conservation.
